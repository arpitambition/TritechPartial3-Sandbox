Zuercher has made multiple attempts to contact you in an effort to resolve the issue referenced above.

As of this time, there has not been a response from your agency regarding this issue. Our company policy is to attempt to make contact at least 3 times prior to sending this notice. It is entirely possible that your agency contact has been involved in other duties and has not been available to discuss or work with our Technical Support department to examine the issue.

Zuercher will be placing a ‘Waiting’ status on the service request listed above. This issue will remain in the ‘Waiting’ status for an additional five (5) business days. If a response has not been received by your agency within that time frame, Zuercher will proceed to Suspend the ticket. If upon receiving this notification, your agency has decided that the issue does not need to be addressed, please respond to this email and the ticket will be closed. Your call is important to us, and will remain in our call database as ‘Suspended’, but we would be glad to create a new service request ticket if you decide that the issue needs to be addressed.
