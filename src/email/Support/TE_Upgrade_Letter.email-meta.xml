    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


The {!Account.Name}&apos;s Total Enforcement &lt;production or training&gt; system is scheduled for an upgrade on &lt;Date and Time&gt;. Please follow these steps for the upgrade to occur as smoothly as possible.

- Ensure all users exit the TE application prior to &lt;Date and Time&gt;
- Send a confirmation email, reply all to this group, that users have exited TE when that occurs
- Upon receipt of an email of the completion of the update, you can resume the use of TE and log back into the software

Sincere Regards,

Management
