We sincerely hope that these two days of education will allow everyone to gain knowledge in the areas desired. Although this is classroom-style training, feel free to bring a laptop if you have access to one and you will be able to participate in some “hands-on” activities. We invite you to dress casually and comfortably for the session. Since room temperatures and preferences vary from person to person, please bring a sweater or sweatshirt to wear if needed.

See you next week!
