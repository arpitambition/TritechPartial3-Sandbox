Interactive Sessions from TriTech Experts and Peers
Come prepared with your questions!
Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Client}},

The value of a user conference comes from quality face time with TriTech staff and fellow clients.  This year&apos;s TriCON agenda features roundtable discussions and forums for an interactive experience.  In order to gain the most value in the discussions and share from each other&apos;s insight, we ask that you come prepared with your questions or ready to share your experience.

To gain the most and fully engage in our roundtables, here are your action items for TriCON:



 - Write down a list of questions you&apos;ve always wanted to ask our Business Analysts  (BAs).  Business Analysts Wendy Cotton, Jamie Simpkins and Chuck Alexander will be leading the &quot;QA the BAs&quot; open session to help you with configuration questions or &quot;how do we&quot; issues that you are having.


 - Bring your response plans or your response plan questions.  We will be conducting a Response Plan roundtable in which a few of your peers will share their own response plans. We invite you to bring your questions or share your own response plans for collaboration and discussion.




Also, if you would like to pre-submit your questions to address in any of the following roundtable discussions, please email them to tricon@tritech.com &lt;https://na-a.marketodesigner.com/mail%20to:%20%20tricon@tritech.com&gt;.


 - Virtualization
 - QA the BAs
 - Response Plan Workshop
 - Geo Roundtable



Looking forward to seeing you soon!</textOnly>
