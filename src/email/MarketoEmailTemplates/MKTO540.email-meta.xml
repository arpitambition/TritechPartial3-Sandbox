    <subject>TriTech News - 1st Quarter Newsletter (March 2013)</subject>
    <textOnly>In This Issue

 It is hard to believe this is the first Quarterly Newsletter for 2013. It seems like 2012 just flew by. I recently had an opportunity to review 2012 and the accomplishments with the Perform team. It was an amazing year thanks to the hard work of the employees, and thanks to you and all of your support. 

I’d like to share some of those 2012 accomplishments with you:


 - Growth - We added 34 new agencies as customers.

 - Customer Service - The National Support Center was established in 2011, but the program was refined and expanded in 2012 with the goal of providing better service for all of TriTech’s 
customers.

 - Re-Brand the TriTech products - The product formerly known as IMC is now Perform. While the name change is cosmetic, the goal of TriTech goes beyond just product name changes. TriTech is building the largest public safety software company in North America. To accomplish this, we are now functioning as one company – with multiple product lines – all of which serve the public safety 
community.   

 - Relocation – In December we moved into our new office in Marlborough, MA. We are still settling in, but the feedback from customers and employees has been positive. Stop by for a visit at our Open House on April 3rd - read more here &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q1_2013_Perform_NewsandEvents.html&gt;.

 - Product – The Research and Development staff delivered Version 4.6.19 (Build 19) and Version 6.0. These two new-feature releases included a lot of product enhancements, but none were more noticeable than the interface to Google Maps.
 - Customer Events - We conducted 12 Regional User Group Meetings that were attended by over 350 customers. We also introduced the Perform Training Institute (PTI). The initial training forum last fall was a sold-out event with 180 customers attending.  

 - Charity – The Perform team raised over $2,000 for charities through employees donations, our company golf tournament, and by 
auctioning off our old building equipment. TriTech donated the funds to C.O.P.S. (Concerns of Police Survivors) and the American Red Cross Sandy Relief. 

 - Online Support - In 2012 TriTech launched the Customer Service Center Portal, allowing web access to the status of your support tickets. Please check out Ellen Manning’s article &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q1_2013_Perform_Support.html&gt; for more information on all of the services available through the portal &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q1_2013_Perform_Support.html&gt;.



So what does 2013 hold in store for Perform customers?

 - Local Training – The Perform Training Institute (PTI) is going on the road!!!

 - We have already conducted a PTI session in Nashua, New Hampshire that focused on Fire Records. That was attended by 30 customers. See photos here &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q1_2013_Perform_NewsandEvents.html&gt;.

 - Rhode Island – Our next event will be at CCRI in Warwick. It only costs $125 per day and includes lunch. Register here &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/March2013_FireLawTraining_TrainingSummit.html&gt;. 

 - March 13th - 9AM-4PM: Best Practices for Building Comprehensive Records in RMS and Crime Analysis.
 - March 14th - 9AM-4PM: System Manager

 - We will be adding other regional training courses and topics throughout the year.

 - Fall PTI Summit is scheduled for October 28th and 29th in Westborough - This year we will focus on fewer topics, but we will get into more detail with longer classes. So mark it on your calendar and check you emails for more details. 
 - More User Groups – Over the spring and summer, we will be conducting 12 Regional User Groups. Look for more information coming soon about these events.
 - New Product Promotions – TriTech has revised our pricing model and this year our products are more affordable than ever. If you have been thinking about adding some of the new modules, you should definitely contact your Client Account Manager.

 - Regional Tradeshows  – please stop by and visit us at these 2013 tradeshow events &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q1_2013_Perform_NewsandEvents.html&gt;.

 - New Product Features – Build 6.1 is in General Availability. Check out the latest on these new features in Leo Hisoire&apos;s article here. &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q1_2013_Perform_Products.html&gt; 


We look forward to an exciting 2013 and providing your department with the best software and services in the industry.
