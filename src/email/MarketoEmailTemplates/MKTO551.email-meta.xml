    <textOnly>In This Issue


There is certainly a lot to talk about in this newsletter with TriTech and the Perform Product. But before I touch on that, I have to take a moment to ask for your support for those affected by Hurricane Sandy.  While the storm affected so many, it hits home when you hear from customers in New Jersey that are dealing with the aftermath every day.

We have taken up a collection in the office and made a donation, which I would encourage you to do as well. You can make a contribution through several organizations, but if you would like to donate to the Red Cross, just check this link for the options - http://www.redcross.org/charitable-donations &lt;http://www.redcross.org/charitable-donations&gt;.

Now, onto business news. In the next couple of weeks, we will be moving our office to Marlborough, MA. Our new address will be 313 Boston Post Road, Suite 140, Marlborough, MA  01752, which is close to the intersection of Route 20 and Interstate 495. This is a multi-tenant building that is part of a campus which includes a shared conference room, a shared training facility, and a cafeteria. We are excited about the new facilities and the new location.

The other big news is the overwhelming success of the recently completed Perform Training Institute (PTI) Fall 2012 Training Summit. The event was held at the DoubleTree in Westborough, MA and was attended by 180 customers. We received lots of positive feedback on the course material and the presenters, but equally important was the chance to exchange ideas and information with peers.The departments represented have used our product for a combined 1,020 years; that is an average of 11.3 years per department at 
the event.

Be sure to read the full story on PTI in the News and Events Section. You will also get more details on our training goals in 2013 from that article. This edition of the newsletter also contains an update on the Customer Service Center. Check out this story along with the other latest news from TriTech.

Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your public safety technology provider.
Phil Sisk, VP of Operations
