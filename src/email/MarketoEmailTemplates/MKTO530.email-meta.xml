Best Practices for Building Comprehensive Records in RMS and Crime Analysis
A Records Management System is the central repository for all of your agency’s law enforcement information. This presentation will provide an overview and demonstration of the capabilities in Perform RMS that can provide a 360-degree view of incidents, people, vehicles and location information. Information on patterns can help law enforcement agencies deploy resources in a more effective manner. This session will also help you make sense out of the data captured in your Perform Records to produce crime analysis reports for your agency’s use.
