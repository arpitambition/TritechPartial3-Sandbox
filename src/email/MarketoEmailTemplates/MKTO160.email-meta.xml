GA12-001 - Potential problem with Microsoft Security patch MS11-030 
 
Dear Clients,
 


The Technical Advisory GA12-001 - Potential problem with Microsoft Security patch MS11-030 has been posted to the MyVisiNet support site.  In April 2011 Microsoft released 9 security updates, which were approved by TriTech through Technical Advisory GA11 – 012. One of these updates is MS11-030 addressing a vulnerability in DNS Resolution which could allow remote code execution.  As a result of implementing this update, a few of our customers running Stratus servers have reported CAD slowness.  Please read the full advisory for recommendations from TriTech regarding this issue.


You may access this advisory via the MyVisiNet Support site under Documentation | Tech Advisories | VisiNet Advisories | 2012 or by clicking on the link included in this email.
