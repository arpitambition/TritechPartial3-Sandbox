Your New Client Account Manager

Greetings!

&lt;View Personalized Greeting Here: http://offers.tritech.com/TylerHarmanIntro_LandingPage.html&gt;

My name is Tyler Harman, and I am your TriTech Account Manager for our Sweet-Billing, Sweet-CAD and Fusion ePCR software applications. I look forward to working with you and your organization.

Here’s a little bit more about myself: I am a new employee at TriTech and a native of Decorah, Iowa, where our EMS offices are located. My wife, Sarah, and I have a 1-year-old son named Kalin that constantly keeps us on our toes! I love being outdoors (but not during the winter) and enjoy running, hiking and fishing. I am a big sports fan and am an avid supporter of the Iowa Hawkeyes, New York Mets and Oakland Raiders. I have a B.A. from Simpson College and an M.A. from Western Michigan University. I have worked solely in sales and marketing thus far in my career but in a variety of industries, including minor league baseball, college athletics and commercial insurance.

Should you have any questions or need additional information, please contact me at 800.537.3927 ext. 6280 or by emailing tyler.harman@tritech.com. I look forward to working with you and your company to customize a solution that best fits your needs!
