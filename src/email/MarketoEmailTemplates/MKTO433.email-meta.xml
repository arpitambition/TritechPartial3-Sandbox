A Truly AMAZING Experience

Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Client}},

Thank you to our customers, sponsors, and staff for making TriCON 2012 an amazing experience. We hope that you found the new products innovative, the training informative, and the networking valuable.  

The feedback received from the surveys is serving as an excellent resource in our initial planning. In 2013, the TriTech User Conference will evolve into a TriTech Industry and Training Summit featuring an expanded program with a primary focus on training.  The event will be held in San Diego, and you can expect registration fees to remain the same. 

To guarantee your attendance, you can include the event&apos;s registration, hotel and airfare into your Support Maintenance Agreement (SMA).  If interested in more information or to include the event fees in SMA please contact Jenny Clavero at (858) 799-7362 or email tricon@tritech.com &lt;mail to: tricon@tritech.com&gt;.
