As I look back at the 19 years I’ve been with TriTech, I am amazed at how the industry has changed - but more importantly - what’s in store for the next generation. Technology is constantly evolving, which continues to put pressure on all software vendors. Not all vendors have the resources to continue in the future in EMS billing. TriTech has the resources, as well as the depth of understanding about the industry and insight into where it is going. Web-based access to your EMS software is just one example of the future. As many of you have migrated from On-Premise software to online software, you have experienced first-hand the many benefits that come along with it: access from anywhere in a secured environment, multiple back-up redundancy, automatic updates, and a pricing model that fits any size 
business. We’ve had 23 TriTech customers move from On-Premise delivery models to our Cloud, and 22 new TriTech customers purchase TriTech Cloud-based EMS software in 2012 (with over 100 customers in total currently on the Cloud model). For our valued customers, we have special pricing options, based on your history and prior investment with TriTech, so please contact us if you are interested in learning more.

As we look toward 2013, the EMS industry 
is constantly keeping our customers and us ’on guard‘ - wondering what the next required mandate will be. On the good side, you can expect some exciting new options to be rolled out in your billing software. Thank you to our customers who have continuously given us feedback on what they would like to see in TriTech Billing! TriTech is continuously evolving and each of you is important to us. 

Wishing you a successful end-of-year! 

Karla Hageman 
National Sales Director
