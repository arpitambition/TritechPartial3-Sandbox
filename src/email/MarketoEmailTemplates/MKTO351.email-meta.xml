    <textOnly>In This Issue



Welcome to the Third Quarterly TriTech Customer Newsletter.

In the last issue &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q2_2012_NC_Main.html&gt;, we highlighted a new logo, Vision product updates and the Inform 5.0 release, a new brand name, the TriCON annual conference agenda sneak peak, industry news and webinars, and client go-lives.

In this edition, you will find important updates on products, documentation, technology, monthly customer service webinars, the tritech.com website, and TriCON. I encourage you to take a few minutes to review this information, and I’ll start off with a couple timely and important topics.

VisionCAD 3.7.1 and VisionMOBILE 3.7.1 General Availability Release
During the month of July, a number of product releases reached General Availability status including VisionCAD 3.7.1 and VisionMOBILE 3.7.1. A &apos;What’s New&apos; PowerPoint presentation is available for both products, highlighting the new functionality being offered. As a summary, included in both releases is media integration and VisionFIRE 5.0 integration.

SQL Server License Model Changes:
Microsoft recently announced changes to their SQL Server license model, which will take effect with the release of SQL Server 2012. These changes also affect the acquisition of previous SQL versions, which will be considered downgrades. TriTech wants to ensure you are aware of these changes and have the information necessary to choose the model that is best for your environment. SQL Server licensing has changed from a per-processor license to per-core license for Enterprise Edition and either a per-core or a server plus CAL for Standard Edition. When purchasing SQL Server licenses in the future, customers are encouraged to count users/devices and decide if the total licensing costs are lower using the Server / CAL or the Per-Core licensing model.

TriTech is continuously working to ensure our customers have the best solutions at the best value. As SQL Server 2012 will offer expanded virtualization rights, options and benefits to provide greater flexibility for customers deploying in virtual environments, TriTech is currently defining the options available to deploy our solutions in this manner. Additionally as new versions of server and workstation operating systems are introduced, we will update you with our plans to support compatibility with these versions.

For questions regarding the new Microsoft License Model, TriTech recommends contacting your Microsoft Customer Support Representative. Any questions regarding this correspondence please contact your TriTech Account Representative.
