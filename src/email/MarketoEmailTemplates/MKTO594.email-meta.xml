Billing Software Group Training
Registration Closes for Evergreen, CO on May 26
Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

By maximizing the use of your billing software, you gain greater efficiencies and maximize your revenue. Our two-day Group Trainings are hosted at customer locations and typically involve 10-20 billing software users who share insights and workflow tips as they learn from an experienced TriTech trainer about the practical use of the billing program.

 

These courses have been approved by the National Academy of Ambulance Coding (NAAC &lt;https://www.ambulancecoding.com/default.aspx&gt;) for 11.0 continuing education units.
