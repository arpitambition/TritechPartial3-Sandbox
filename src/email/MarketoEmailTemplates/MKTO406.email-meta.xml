From the Desk of Mike Lyons...


DATE:      September 26, 2012
TO:          VisionAIR Customer Base
FR:           Message from Michael (Mike) Lyons, Vice President of Operations, TriTech Software Systems and  former CEO of VisionAIR (acquired by TriTech in September 2011).
SUB:        Executive Transition Notice
Hanging on the back of my office door are 30 or so name tags, dangling at the end of colored lanyards - mementos from user’s conferences and trade shows that I’ve attended over the last ten years. Most of them say VisionAIR somewhere on the badge along with my name, a title, and a date. The newer ones look a little different with TriTech boldly printed on the front; they’re in brighter colors but are otherwise indistinguishable from the others. I keep them there because they are great reminders of people and places and times I’ve enjoyed.

As most of you are aware, TriTech Software Systems (TriTech) is currently celebrating their annual user’s conference (TriCON 2012) in San Diego, California. The conference is truly a great opportunity for our clients to learn more about the company, its products and services, and most importantly to get to know the great people that make up this remarkable company.

While I’m really excited to be at TriCON 2012, it will likely be my last conference for a while. In early October, I’m going to be changing my role at TriTech and taking a big step personally towards realizing a dream of starting up my own company. For a number of years, I’ve been a student and practitioner of employee engagement and personal development strategies as they relate to our working lives. During this time, working with and learning about many different kinds of organizations, I’ve come to realize this is where I want to focus the next chapter of my working life. My goal is to facilitate strong and sustainable trust-based relationships between employees and employers.

Thanks to TriTech’s leadership, they are affording me one of those rare chances in a lifetime of pursuing a dream and putting that dream into action for the service of others. The company has offered me a number of ways to stay involved and contribute to the success of TriTech. Perhaps most notably, I have an opportunity to serve on the TriTech Board of Directors, which I am honored and very excited about. Working with smart, well-informed people creates a great learning environment and the current TriTech board members offer a rich opportunity for such an environment. Additionally, I will continue to represent TriTech in a number of industry organizations, specifically The IJIS Institute and Industry Council for Emergency Response Technology (iCERT). Both of these organizations have long term missions which align and serve the best interests of public safety and the company’s valued clients. Finally, working in the role of a consultant and focusing on employee engagement, I look forward to helping foster and enrich the healthy work environment and corporate culture at TriTech and elsewhere.

The TriTech leadership team, under direction of our CEO, Chris Maloney, has fully embraced the solution portfolio and personnel resources that enabled VisionAIR to serve all of you. As you may already know, many of the familiar names and faces that you have come to know over time at VisionAIR are actively contributing to the ongoing success of TriTech. Just to provide a few examples, Gary Bunyard is now in charge of all of TriTech’s Sales activities, Scott MacDonald is now responsible for the entire Product Management organization tied to the Inform Suite of solutions, and Denise Sheffield is responsible for all Customer Support activities for our Inform Suite of solutions. These individuals and many more are now part of the unified TriTech team that is working every day to serve all of you.  

As I transition from my daily operations role at TriTech to a Board position and outside consultant, I know that you all of you will be extremely pleased with the support you will continue to receive as well as the future direction of TriTech’s solutions and services portfolio.

In closing, this message isn’t intended to be a a farewell letter - it’s more like an address change notice. But, since it seems appropriate, I want to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and your organization over the last ten years. You have my deepest respect for the work you do in serving the public good and protecting our communities. I have learned a lot of life’s important lessons from you and have challenged myself to meet a similar level of service and commitment that in my perspective, you have shown in your work on a daily basis.

Best regards,
Mike</textOnly>
