    <textOnly>Justify Your Trip to TriCON

September 13 - 16  l  Boston, Massachusetts

In these budget conscious times, it is only natural for a manager to ask, “How can we justify spending money to participate in a conference when we are facing budget reductions?” The answer lies in the value of the conference’s content and the focused interaction it provides. Sometimes learning one new piece of information or gaining better understanding about only one process can justify the entire cost of attending TriCON. And making one professional contact can be worth much more. 


To help your agency be part of this important educational event, we&apos;re providing you with an ROI / Justification Letter.
