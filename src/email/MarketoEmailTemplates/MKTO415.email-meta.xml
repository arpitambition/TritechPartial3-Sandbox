Registration will begin on the first day at 7:45 a.m. We sincerely hope that these two days of education will allow everyone to gain knowledge in the areas desired. Although this is classroom-style training, feel free to bring a laptop if you have access to one and you will be able to participate in some “hands-on” activities. 
 
We invite you to dress casually and comfortably for the session. Since room temperatures and preferences vary from person to person, please bring a sweater or sweatshirt to wear if needed.  

See you next week!
