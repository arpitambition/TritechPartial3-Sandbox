This is a small token of our appreciation, thanking you for your support of TriTech Software Systems and our training initiatives. Please join us for a relaxed evening of refreshments and networking with fellow clients and TriTech staff.

As the event draws near, there are likely questions that you or other department members may have. Please feel free to contact me directly with any questions or comments you may have.

We look forward to seeing you.
