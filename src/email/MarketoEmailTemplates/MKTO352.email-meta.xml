    <textOnly>In This Issue



Welcome to the Third Quarterly TriTech Customer Newsletter.

In the last issue, &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q2_2012_CO_Main.html&gt; we highlighted a new logo, the version 3.1 release of QuickResponse, a new brand name, the TriCON annual conference agenda sneak peak, industry news and webinars, and client go-lives.
In this edition, you will find important updates on products, documentation, technology, monthly customer service webinars, the tritech.com website, and TriCON. I encourage you to take a few minutes to review this information, and I’ll start off with a couple timely and important topics.

PMO (Project Management Office) Organization

Right after the acquisition of 911 Inc. by TriTech Software Systems, a number of 911 clients pointed out that the organization needed additional staffing focused on delivery and service. Efforts were taken during the first quarter of 2012 which took that advice and put it into action. Over the last few months, I’m pleased to say that we have added four new resources to the team, several of whom you will recall from the past. Leading the group is Jerry Pope, serving as the Sr. Manager of Implementations. In this role Jerry is responsible for organizing and coordinating all of the resources involved in delivery and support of the 911 products.

Supporting Jerry is Billy Bobian, a returning employee who is filling an Installation Support Engineering role. Tom Hendrix, another new member to the implementation team, is serving as a second Installation Support Engineer. A third Installation Support Engineer is Scott Simms who joined the team recently, bringing with him notable Avaya certifications and a great deal of technical telephony experience. Rounding out the team is Janene Luders who provides support to all of the company’s projects and delivery efforts. The team has been doing a great job coming up to speed and getting to the business of providing world class installation and support services.

Thank you for the opportunity to let TriTech serve as your public safety technology provider.
