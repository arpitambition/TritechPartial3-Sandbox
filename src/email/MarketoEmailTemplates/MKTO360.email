<div><strong>SAN DIEGO, CA (August 15, 2012)</strong> &ndash;<a href="http://www.tritech.com/" target="_blank"></a> The Joint Powers Authority Governing Board for the Yolo Emergency Communications Agency (YECA) selected <a href="http://www.tritech.com/" target="_blank">TriTech Software 
System's</a> computer aided dispatch (CAD) and mobile solutions to improve services to its member agencies and their citizens.
 Through a competitive RFP process, TriTech was selected because of their ability to provide a modern, cost effective solution as well as high customer satisfaction levels, reported by multiple customers during site visits.&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;We were looking for a new system with modern 
features, and the new TriTech solution offers exactly that,&rdquo; says Mike Bowler, IT Manager for YECA.
 &ldquo;The CAD system&rsquo;s integrated mapping capabilities provide us with a map-centric solution for more informed decision making; the system captures more information throughout the call to deliver more detailed reporting and staffing analysis.
 TriTech provided us with the best price and feature value &ndash; features we have dreamed about in a system that fits within the scope of our budget and timeframe for implementation.&rdquo;<br /><br />YECA is a prime example of city and county entities working together to solve problems in the 
most efficient way possible.
 As a consolidated 9-1-1 public safety answering point (PSAP) for Yolo County Sheriff, the Police Departments for the cities of Woodland, West Sacramento, Winters, and 17 fire agencies, YECA was seeking a proven solution that provides multi-jurisdiction dispatch capabilities for both police and 
fire.
 The dispatching of resources across agencies has been a cumbersome, manual process managed through Excel worksheets; however, the new TriTech system enables a more automatic and fluid response between city and county agencies and jurisdictions.
 The TriTech CAD and Mobile applications will support more information and resource sharing as well as collaboration between cities and county to improve the speed of response and ensure that the right people respond to the right place, at the right time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;As a 
Joint Powers Authority, we are held accountable to our governing board and their member agencies, and the citizens that they serve,&rdquo; says Ray Groom, Interim Communications Center Manager of YECA.
 &ldquo;We went through a very competitive selection process and found TriTech to be the most qualified vendor.
 With an annual call volume of over 200,000, we are a very large PSAP, and TriTech has many successful implementations in agencies of similar and even larger size with more complex than us.
 During our site visits, many TriTech customers expressed satisfaction and enthusiastically recommended TriTech.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br /><br />"TriTech's extensive experience with consolidated PSAPs and agencies with complex requirements allows us to provide YECA with a proven system to manage their 
multi-agency, multi-jurisdiction operations in a consolidated environment,&rdquo; says Chris Maloney, President and CEO of TriTech Software Systems.
 &ldquo;Our systems can be highly tailored to provide YECA with a common platform while preserving each member agency's unique individual operating requirements.
 A common platform without compromise is our goal."</div>
