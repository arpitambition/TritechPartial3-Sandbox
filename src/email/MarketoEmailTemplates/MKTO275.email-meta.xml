Presentation Description:
We all need to learn from our mistakes and we should share what we learned, rather than keep it quiet. We need to objectively “critique” our patient care as part of a robust QA program, so we can improve our performance, improve quality of care, and ensure we are meeting our standards of care. A big concern is lawsuits and how to “protect” documents and reports from discovery when they are created as part of the quality assurance process. This webinar presentation will discuss the legal “ins and outs” of “peer review” and QA programs to maximize legal protection and to minimize the risk of discovery of documents used in this essential process</textOnly>
