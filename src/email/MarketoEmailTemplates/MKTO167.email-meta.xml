GA12-003 - Further updates to SQL Server 2008 Lock ups

POSTED: 02-02-12

Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Clients}},

In July of 2011, we released an update to Tech Advisory GA10-042. This update was based on a group of TriTech clients reporting CAD system down events where Microsoft SQL Server 2008 on the VisiCAD Production Database Server becomes unresponsive. 

Microsoft has provided further updates to this problem, which are discussed in detail in Technical Advisory GA12-003 - Further updates to SQL Server 2008 Lock ups.  You may access this advisory via the MyVisiNet Support site under Documentation | Tech Advisories | Technical Advisories | 2012.


Sincerely,


Tony Vardiman
