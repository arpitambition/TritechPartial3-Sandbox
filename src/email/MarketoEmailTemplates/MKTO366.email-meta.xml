TriTech.com - Newly Designed Website
August 20, 2012

TriTech Software Systems is excited to announce the launch of their newly designed website &lt;http://www.tritech.com/&gt;, which goes live today and is located at the same tritech.com address. You&apos;ll find a fresh, crisp design with simplified navigation and TriTech&apos;s complete product offerings, now aligned under four new product suites:  


- Inform: Enterprise Public Safety 911 Call-Taking, CAD, RMS, Mobile, and Intelligence applications (formerly VisiNet, Vision, and 911-Inc. brand names) for PSAPs, Law Enforcement and Fire Protection agencies, and entire city and community public safety systems.


- Perform: Quick deployment Public Safety solutions (formerly IMC brand names) providing high value and scalable integrated applications for CAD, RMS, Mobile and back office to field functions for law and fire.


- Respond: EMS CAD, ePCR and Billing (formerly Sweet and Fusion brand names) – equipping providers with valuable tools to ensure regulatory compliancy, maximize profitability and improve patient care.


- TriTech.com: TriTech’s web-based applications; with more than 8 years of offering applications via the internet and over 100 customers attesting to the proven performance and online benefits, look for more TriTech.com solutions coming soon!


You&apos;ll find solutions that you know well, in addition to new products that we are introducing to the market, as well as showcasing for our clients at TriCON &lt;http://www.tritech.com/News-and-Events/One-Company-One-Conference-One-Amazing-Experience&gt;. The new products have been developed from the combined strengths of the former brands, with a focus on enhanced workflow and real-time connectivity - providing you with innovative, integrated solutions to advance your operation.
