will be unavailable; also you will be unable to Datalink your TriTech.com ePCR Mobile (D-Con) Clients. You may continue to use your TriTech.com ePCR Mobile Clients, with the exception of the Datalink process. This maintenance is scheduled to be completed by Monday, October 8 at 6AM CDT (7AM EDT, 4AM PDT).

On Monday, October 8 when access to TriTech.com ePCR is available, please use the following NEW web address online.tritech.com &lt;https://online.tritech.com/&gt; to connect to your TriTech.com ePCR LAN Clients. Please note, at this time your TriTech.com ePCR Mobile Clients will need to be reconfigured to Datalink with the new server. This reconfiguration will be done using the TriTech Thumb Drive you received in the mail. 

Please be sure to communicate the NEW (online.tritech.com &lt;online.tritech.com&gt;) web address to any staff member who accesses TriTech.com ePCR LAN Clients, as of Sunday, October 7 at 12AM CDT (1AM EDT, 10PM PDT), the web address they currently 
use will no longer be available.
