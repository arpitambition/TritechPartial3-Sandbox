URGENT Testing Information for Palmetto GBA Medicare Submitters

Sweet-Billing has just been approved by Palmetto GBA for production submission of HIPAA 5010 claims. This means that Palmetto GBA Medicare Submitters can get streamlined approval for 5010 Production.

HOWEVER, to get this streamlined approval, you must provide us with your Submitter ID(s) so we can provide it to Palmetto GBA in a list of our customers. If you submit to multiple Palmetto jurisdictions, please provide your submitter numbers for each.

Please copy and paste this link into a web browser window: http://offers.tritech.com/2011_PalmettoSubmitterInfo_Oct_LandingPage.html to access a form to provide your submitter ID(s) to us so that we can create the list that has been requested by Palmetto GBA. 

PLEASE PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. JANUARY 1, 2012 IS LESS THAN 100 DAYS AWAY. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUBMIT YOUR MEDICARE CLAIMS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2012.

If you are not the person to respond to this email, please forward to the person who is.

Thank you for your cooperation.
