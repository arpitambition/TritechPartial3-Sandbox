    <textOnly>Is Web-Based EMS Software the Way of the Future?
Register for a Complimentary Live Webinar on March 13


Hello {{lead.First Name:default=EMS Professional}},


Many applications and services, such as Salesforce, gMail, Yahoo Mail, banking, shopping, movies, TV shows, Mapping, Google Docs, and various kinds of training, are now being delivered over the internet in an online or web-based computing model. With web-based software, the software vendor manages the application, data and backend infrastructure while the end user utilizes the software securely over the Internet through a web browser.

-Is EMS software trending towards a similar web-based model rather than installed on your computers? 
-How can a web-based solution benefit your service? 
-What are considerations you need to be aware of?

Join TriTech Senior Product Manager, Charlie Barry and AmbCoach, Inc. President, Kimberly Walk as they provide both the business and user perspectives of the web-based trend in EMS Software.
