Client Announcement
April 22, 2013
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Perform Customer}},

TriTech’s Perform software version 6.1.12 is now available for download from our Customer Service Center portal. You may access this by logging in from www.TriTech.com &lt;http://www.tritech.com&gt;. 

If you do not yet have access to the Customer Service Center portal you may request this by emailing our Customer Service Team at PerformSupport@TriTech.com &lt;mailto:performsupport@tritech.com&gt; or calling our new phone number at 800-987-0911 (Option #4) to request portal access.

Please note: Before installing Version 6.1 you must first ensure that you have done the following: updated to Version 6.0 (either 6.0.18 or 6.0.19) for your server and all mobiles and logged into each Perform module (i.e., Perform RMS, Perform CAD, Perform Fire RMS, etc.) on at least one in-house workstation that is 
connected to the server, as well as log into each module on every mobile unit. You may need to repeat the login multiple times until the software loads and you get to the main screen. Once this is done, you may proceed with download and installing Version 6.1.

And don’t forget about our monthly webinars!
