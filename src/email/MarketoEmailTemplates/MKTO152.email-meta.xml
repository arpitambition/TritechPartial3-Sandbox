CRM Tool Training


Dear Clients,


As we are ready to launch the new SalesForce customer portal on Monday (12/19), we have created a training video to introduce you to some of the features of the new system, such as:

Creating, Editing and Viewing Tickets
Searching for Knowledbase Article and Documents
For Customer Portal Managers:  
      The ability to generate reports 
      Managing your agency&apos;s contacts


We encourage you to view the video, at your convenience, prior to logging in to the system.  As a reminder, we have now disabled the previous customer portal.  We will send your login information for the new customer portal prior to the designated go-live time of 5:30am Pacific Time on Monday, December 19th.  


You may access the video via the MyVisiNet Support site under Training | SalesForce Training.


Sincerely, 


Tony Vardiman
