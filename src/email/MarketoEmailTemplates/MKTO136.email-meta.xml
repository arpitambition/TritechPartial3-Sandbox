VisiNet Solutions Documentation Survey

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

TriTech is continuously looking for ways to strengthen the quality of our products and services.  The  Customer Satisfaction Survey completed in early September indicated that  improving documentation is one of your main  concerns. We are contacting you today because we would like your valuable feedback in an effort to make our documentation more accessible and useful. 

Please click this link to complete a quick 5-minute documentation survey.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to provide us with your candid input. The survey will close Monday, November 21.  

In order to solicit responses from our general user base, please feel free to forward this email to others in your department who may be able to provide us with valuable input.  If you have any questions or encounter any difficulties with this survey link, please contact Jenny Clavero from our Marketing Department at (858) 799-7362 or email jenny.clavero@tritech.com.

Sincerely,

Yvonne Stringer
Quality Assurance Manager
