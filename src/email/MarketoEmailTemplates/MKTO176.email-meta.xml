Quick Response Support Portal Transition
February 13, 2012
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},



Welcome to TriTech.com - a VisionAIR/ TriTech company site and gateway to your Quick Response Support Portal. As we continue transitioning under the TriTech Software Systems banner, we are transitioning out of the 911-Inc.com website to TriTech.com. On February 15, 2012, the 911-Inc.com website will no longer be available.

Customer Support is available to you in three ways.


	- Call 800-987-0911
	- Login to your customer support portal here &lt;https://na3.salesforce.com/sserv/login.jsp?orgId=00D300000000if7&gt;
	- Or, access customer support on TriTech.com &lt;http://www.tritech.com&gt; by selecting “Client Login” and then clicking on “Quick Response”



It is important to note that the customer support portal/Quick Response site that you will be logging into is a VisionAIR, a TriTech company, webpage that has been set up especially for your use.

TriTech is committed to delivering the best customer service in the industry. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have questions or need assistance.

 

Sincerely,

Mike Lyons

Vice President of Operations | Castle Hayne, North Carolina
