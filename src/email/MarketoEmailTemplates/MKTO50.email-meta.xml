 Customer Service Feedback Survey
 Thank you to everyone who took the time to complete our customer service feedback survey.  TriTech VisiNet Solutions wants to make sure that every customer has an important voice in the development and delivery of their VisiNet software products and service. Every six months, customers will have an opportunity to provide feedback to TriTech’s management on changes that they would like to see, as well as those things that they would like to stay the same. Please take time to participate in these surveys. We’re keeping them short to encourage your participation, and conducting them often enough that we are responding to your business needs in a time-sensitive manner.
