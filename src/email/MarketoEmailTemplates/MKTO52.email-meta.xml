    <textOnly>Things to Know Before You Go
September 13 - 16  l  Boston, Massachusetts

With just days before the start of TriCON, below are a few tips to help you pack, plan and prepare to fully capitalize on your TriCON experience.   


Things to Know Before You Go:

Plan Your Schedule - Download the TriCON app (available at iTunes or Android Market) or program for an in-depth look at our event program so that you may plan your week accordingly.  

Hands on Lab - Don&apos;t forget to spend some time in the hands on lab to take new TriTech versions for a test drive or work with staff on refining your workflow.

Get connected - Bring lots of business cards or download mobile apps (LinkedIn, Facebook, Bump, Evernote) on your smartphone to collect contact information to grow your professional TriTech network.

Exhibit Hall - We have some fantastic sponsors showcasing the latest hardware and software in public safety and medical transport.  Click here to take a closer look at all of our sponsors and make sure to schedule time with them accordingly.

Attire - Comfortable and casual clothing are recommended. Don&apos;t forget to include a sweater or light jacket in case the temperature in the rooms are too cool for you or if the temperatures change in the evening.

Transportation - We recommend taking a taxi, the subway or shuttle to get from the airport to the hotel.  Boston is dubbed &quot;The Walking City&quot; so you won&apos;t need a rental car.  

Exploring Boston - We are excited about our new conference city and hope you are too!  The hotel is located in the heart of Boston just steps away from Freedom Trail, Back Bay and other attractions and restaurants.   

All of us at TriTech Software Systems are looking forward to seeing you next week.  If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to contact Jenny Clavero in the TriTech Marketing Department on her mobile (858) 922-6676 or email jenny.clavero@tritech.com.


Safe travels.
