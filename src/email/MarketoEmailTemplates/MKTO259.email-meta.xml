TriTech Aligns Resources
One Company Annoucement
This year marks the fifth year since IMC (Information Management Corporation) became a TriTech Company. Over the last five years, TriTech has been assembling the leading public safety software providers (i.e. IMC, Sweet/Ortivus, VisionAIR) together with one single focus – providing the best public safety software solutions. That effort has unified the best people and products in the industry today, resulting in the most trusted and innovative enterprise-wide solution in Law, Fire, 911 Dispatch and EMS.

 While the company will continue to operate from its existing locations in North Grafton, MA; Wilmington, NC; Decorah, IA; and San Diego, CA – the 2012 focus is to strategically align all resources under a single structure, team and company. Here are some highlights:
 
Google Map Integration
As TriTech’s IMC product line continues to serve over 800 law and fire agencies and evolve with the backing of a full development team, it is the FIRST TriTech product line to offer Google Map Integration – functionality that will be leveraged in other TriTech product lines.
 
Leading Edge Technology
TriTech is able to share developmental innovations and resources to advance solutions and bring leading-edge technology to market faster. TriTech’s technology expertise, development processes and best practices will be shared across all product lines.
 
Employee Expertise
Did you know that TriTech’s 350+ employees average more than a decade of public safety industry experience? This means a stronger industry presence (i.e. iCERT, APCO, IJIS, IACP, NENA, etc.), shared field experience and better communication with our 2,500 customer agencies.
 
Customer Service Excellence
Excellence in customer service is being standardized across the company, utilizing best practices, common processes and performance benchmarks. TriTech’s National Support Center will continue to monitor customer satisfaction and listen and respond to your needs to deliver the best customer support experience in the industry. Courtesy, quality, excellent service – our promise to you.
 
New Logo
As of May 1, 2012, all former brands are now “TriTech Software Systems.” To celebrate our strength and cohesiveness as one company, a new TriTech logo will be introduced (upper right-hand corner of this email) that emphasizes our identity as one company - built upon the strengths of the best and most experienced minds in public safety software. 
 
Growing, Growing, Growing…
More than 132 agencies have joined the IMC software user base in the past five years since we have been TriTech; the registration count for the Spring 2012 Regional User Groups is the largest yet; and the System Admin training sessions have sold out in record time.
 
All of these changes mean TriTech is able to offer the most complete, integrated, end-to-end, enterprise-wide public safety software solution - moreso than any other company in the industry. We’re large enough to withstand economic swings, but not so large that you, our customers, won’t get the personal service you need and deserve. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to let TriTech serve as your public safety technology provider. One company…many solutions…
