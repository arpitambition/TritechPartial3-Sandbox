Winner Announcement   
Thanks for Attending EMS World EXPO
 
Congratulations Marsha Heckler of Mario County EMS
She was the lucky winner of our Apple iPad 2 drawing!

A big thanks to everyone who stopped by our booth at the recent EMS World EXPO in Las Vegas. We hope you enjoyed the show!


We get it - you have too many calls, not enough staff and too much pressure. Making sense of the future is our business. We&apos;re helping medical transportation agencies reshape the way they manage information to help them focus on what&apos;s important. Do you think your agency needs to be reshaped? 

If you were unable to make it to the booth during the show, no problem. See how our ePCR (http://www.tritech.com/products/ems-solutions/fusion-epcr) and Billing (http://www.tritech.com/products/ems-solutions/sweet-billing) solutions are helping our clients reshape the way they manage information right now.

See It . Believe It. Experience It.
