VisiNet Solutions Documentation Survey

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

What do you think of our VisiNet User and Admin Guides - are they helpful?  Do you want us to incorporate more use case examples or see more online tutorials?  This is your chance to tell us what we can do to make our documentation more useful.  

Please click this link (http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2011-VisiNetDocumentation)  to complete a quick 5-minute documentation survey.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to provide us with your candid input. The survey will close Wednesday, November 23.  



Sincerely,

Yvonne Stringer
Quality Assurance Manager
TriTech Software Systems | VisiNet Solutions
