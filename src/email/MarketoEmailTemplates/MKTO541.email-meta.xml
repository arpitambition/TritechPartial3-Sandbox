    <textOnly>In This Issue

In the last issue &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q4_2012_IA_main.html&gt;, Karla introduced you to the excitement that we at TriTech are feeling for the next generation (NextGen) 
technologies for the EMS industry. While industry regulation changes consistently keep us on our toes – (Sequestration &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57571722/sequestration-looms-but-when-will-the-hurt-feel-real/&gt;, anyone?) – the next version of Respond Billing &lt;http://www.tritech.com/products/respond/respond-billing&gt; goes far beyond boring 
regulations and gets to show its fun, flirty side again. The “fun, flirty side” arrives in Version 5.9, and its features anchor TriTech in the leader position in the EMS billing software race. With all the new features arriving in Respond Billing 5.9, we also begin the 
push to educate our customers on those features. You’ll learn about Virtual Multi-Leg Call (VMLC), Real-time Eligibility Checking, and changes to both Remittance Processing and Denial Codes. 

Continue reading further in this newsletter for more information in the article written by Dan Voss &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q1_2013_Respond_Products.html&gt;, our billing Product Manager, for 
additional details about each feature.

Also, keep a close eye on our website and Customer Service Center (portal) for new live classes and recorded sessions which introduce our customers to all the good things coming in Version 5.9 of billing.

It&apos;s time to put on your thinking/learning 
hat!
