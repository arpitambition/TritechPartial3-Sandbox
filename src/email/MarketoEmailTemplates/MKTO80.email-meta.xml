Customer Thursdays and Engineering Level Support


Dear Clients,


I would like to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on recent process improvements implemented at the San Diego office to help us expedite the resolution of your support incidents.  These 
updates were presented by Chris Maloney during his opening presentation  at the 2011 TriCon Conference, but I wanted to send this follow-up communication to ensure you have been informed of these updates, in case you were unable to attend this year’s annual conference.


The Customer Satisfaction Survey completed early September indicated that improving the turnaround time to resolve your issues is one of your main concerns.  These results reaffirmed our focus to deploy 
several service initiatives for improvements in this area.  Please read the full communication to learn about the process changes we have implemented to positively influence our 
response time and enhance our ability to resolve your tickets.


Sincerely, 



Dora Wood
