TriTech Perform (formerly IMC) Software Update in Massachusetts

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}}, 

TriTech is proud of our customers and of the Perform product suite (formerly known as IMC) that helps the people who protect and serve us. Over the past month, our Pre-Release customers have been giving positive feedback about our new Google Maps Interface. Google Maps is just one of the many ways TriTech is revolutionizing Public Safety Software. We are equally excited about our new Droid Application coming out this winter. 

Most of the employees working on the Perform product line live in Massachusetts, so we get to see firsthand, the great job being done by our customers.
