Tritech Software Training:
Please Respond with Your Input
July 30, 2012
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


In response to the feedback TriTech received at the recent Spring User Group Meetings, we have been evaluating the options for a regional, multi-department training event. We have a tentative location, dates, and curriculum. We think this option would be very cost effective, and the curriculum will help you maximize the use of your TriTech software. 

All we have right now is an idea; to move forward, TriTech needs to gage the user communityâ€™s level of commitment to support this type of event (please see details below). We have put together this survey and your response is critical to shaping how we proceed. We want to ensure we coordinate an event that you would be interested in attending.

Please let us know what you think:
