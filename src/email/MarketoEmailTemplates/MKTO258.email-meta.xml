TriTech Aligns Resources
One Company Annoucement
Two years ago, TriTech acquired Ortivus, bringing the leading public safety software providers (i.e. IMC, Sweet/Ortivus, VisionAIR) together with one single focus – providing the best public safety and EMS software solutions. That effort has unified the best people and products in the industry today, resulting in the most trusted and innovative enterprise-wide solutions in Law, Fire 911 Dispatch and EMS. But we realize that trying to keep track of the latest product or company name has been a little bit like the “Where is Waldo” game. SweetSoft…Amazon…Sweet…Ortivus… 
 
That’s all about to change…
 
Our 2012 focus is to strategically align all of our resources under a single structure, team and company - to provide the greatest resources to our customers. To that end, it is time to leave the old company brand behind and establish TriTech’s new brand. Here are some of the highlights:

Online Functionality
TriTech’s EMS product line serves over 1000 EMS services with the backing of a full development team. It is the first TriTech product suite to offer the full functionality of its billing and ePCR applications online.

Leading Edge Technology
TriTech is able to share developmental innovations and resources to advance solutions and bring leading-edge technology to market faster. TriTech’s technology expertise, development processes and best practices will be shared across all product lines.

Employee Expertise
Did you know that TriTech’s 350+ employees average more than a decade of public safety industry experience? This means a stronger industry presence (i.e. iCERT, APCO, IJIS, IACP, NENA, etc.), shared field experience and better communication with our 2,500 customer agencies.

Customer Service Excellence
Excellence in customer service is being standardized across the company utilizing best practices, common processes and performance benchmarks. TriTech’s National Support Center will continue to monitor customer satisfaction and listen and respond to your needs to deliver the best customer support experience in the industry. Courtesy, quality, excellent service – our promise to you.

New Logo
As of May 1, 2012, “TriTech Emergency Medical Services” is now “TriTech Software Systems.” To celebrate our strength and cohesiveness as one company, a new TriTech logo will be introduced (upper right-hand corner of this email) that emphasizes our identity as one company, built upon the strengths of the best and most experienced minds in public safety software. 

All of these changes mean TriTech is able to offer the most complete, integrated, end-to-end, enterprise-wide public safety software solution – more so than any other company in the industry. We’re large enough to withstand economic swings, but not so large that you, our customers, won’t get the personal service you need and deserve.  
Thank you for the opportunity to let TriTech serve as your public safety and EMS technology provider. One company…many solutions…
