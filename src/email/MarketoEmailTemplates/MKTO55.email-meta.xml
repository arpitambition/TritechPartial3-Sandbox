    <textOnly>THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE
Imc Solutions Customer Satisfaction Survey

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

We want to thank everyone that participated in the August semi-annual customer satisfaction survey. Your input is crucial in measuring our performance and in helping TriTech Software Sytems continually improve the quality of products and services offered to you. The next survey is scheduled for February 2012, please keep an eye on your email inbox.

We want to congratulate Sergeant Douglas DeCosta of Falmouth Police, MA for winning the Apple iPad2® raffle that was comprised of survey respondents.  

TriTech Customer Satisfaction Surveys take just 3-minutes of your time and automatically enter you for a chance to win.

Regards,
The TriTech Marketing Team
