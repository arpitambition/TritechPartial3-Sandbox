 VisiNet Mobile:  &quot;The New Mobile is just like the iPhone&quot; by Bexar County Sheriff&apos;s Office
The Administrators at Bexar County took ownership of the VisiNet Mobile project and customized it for a solution that was easy to learn and use by their personnel.   Bexar County Mobile Administrators customized their Mobile buttons with transparent graphical icons and symbology. Similar to today’s smartphones, the iconography changes provide an intuitive application for a smoother look and feel to facilitate quicker processing and action by deputies. By building a mobile solution that was intuitive and easy to use, training and user adoption was easy and seamless.    Click here to read more&gt;&gt;

     SalesForce Customer Portal
  As we continue to evolve our support operations, we are committed to listening to your feedback as a way to improve the level of service that we provide. Based on your feedback, it became clear to us that our online customer portal did not meet your ongoing support needs. Additionally, due to TriTech’s recent growth, it became necessary to adopt a system that would allow us to support each Business Unit across a standardized platform. As a result, we decided to implement a new customer relationship management tool called SalesForce.  Click here to read more about TriTech&apos;s SalesForce Customer Portal&gt;&gt;
