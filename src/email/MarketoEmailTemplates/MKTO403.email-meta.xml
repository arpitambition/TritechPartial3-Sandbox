Protecting PSAP Applications from Downtime
Strategies for Safeguarding the Mission-Critical Applications First Responders Depend Upon
Hello {{lead.First Name:default=TriCON Attendee}},

If you are considering a technology upgrade for legacy software or are about to publish an RFP for updating all or part of your PSAP operations, it is important to understand what it takes to minimize unplanned downtime for your applications and systems.

Protecting PSAP Applications from Downtime is a Stratus eBook that addresses different strategies to improve the availability of mission-critical applications and minimize the possibility of disruptions caused by server failure. It describes the advantages and disadvantages of dedicated servers, cluster technology, virtualization, high availability and fault-tolerance.

Download this eBook &lt;http://go.stratus.com/l/3302/2012-03-26/yd8yl?Ref=TriTech&amp;source=Partner&amp;industry=Public%20Safety&gt; and learn:   
•    Why 99% system uptime is not good enough for PSAP applications
•    What technologies can be employed to increase system uptime greater than 99%
•    The pros and cons of various uptime technologies – hardened servers, clusters, virtualization, high availability and fault-tolerance – in terms of ease-of-use, administration and cost
•    What technologies best fit your specific environment

We look forward to meeting you!
Warm Regards,

Charlie
