Reshaping Your Future

Hi 

The public safety industry has changed dramatically within the past five years – budget limitations, increased demands and consolidations. Many Fire-Rescue agencies have been able to balance the ongoing pressures by reshaping the way they manage information to help them focus on what&apos;s important.  

Leveraging advanced technology, South Metro Fire Rescue has been able to reduce their dispatch time to 31 seconds.  In comparison, the national standard is 60 seconds.   Do you think your 9-1-1 center needs to be reshaped?

We would like to share our clients&apos; best practices with others at your agency.  If you would like to send this to a colleague, please click here.
