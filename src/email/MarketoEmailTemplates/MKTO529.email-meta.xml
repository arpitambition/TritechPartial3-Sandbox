 Dear clients,

In observance of the upcoming holiday, the TriTech Software Systems corporate office will be closed Monday, February 18, 2013.  During this time, our on-call Technical Services and Engineering staff will provide support services for urgent issues.

If your system has a serious problem during the holidays (including daytime hours), please call 1-800-VISICAD and an on-call Support Team member will contact you to work on your issue.  If for any reason the 1-800-VISICAD line is not functioning, you can reach us via our backup-line at 858-229-8786.

If your issue is not urgent, please submit your issue electronically (SalesForce or e-mail) or contact us during our regular business hours.
