Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}}, 

Be sure to mark your calendars and plan to attend this fun-filled event which includes golf, dinner, contests and prizes. As in the past, we will be donating any proceeds to COPS and the Leary Foundation. In addition to the fun, you&apos;ll be helping two great causes.
