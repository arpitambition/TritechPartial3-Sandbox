Welcome to the Second Quarterly TriTech Customer Newsletter.

 Since we have been TriTech, more than 135 agencies have joined the IMC software user base. Our registration count for the Spring 2012 User Groups is the largest we’ve ever had and the System Admin training sessions have sold out in record time. In the past we made some mistakes with the quality of our build and release process. We have made lots of changes internally and I have confidence that Build 19 will go a long way toward restoring your confidence in the product. We are driven to provide our customers with the best software and top notch customer service. It is a very exciting time to work with this company and I appreciate the opportunity to serve as your public safety technology provider.

Check out a couple of our User Group Training photos:
