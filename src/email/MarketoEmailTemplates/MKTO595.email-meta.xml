    <textOnly>Please Note: Same Number, New Option (#3) for Reaching Customer Service
Customer Service: 800-987-0911 (option #3)
Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

The TriTech Customer Service Team is moving to a single support phone number across the TriTech product line. It is the same phone number which you have been accustomed to using. However, please note that the options have changed; to reach technical support for the 911 Inc. software, you will need to press a different option after dialing into the toll-free number: 800-987-0911 (option #3). 
 
Remember, you can reach TriTech Customer Service in three easy ways:

 - By Phone: 800-987-0911 (option #3)
 - By email &lt;mailto:911incsupport@tritech.com&gt;
 - Through the Customer Service Center (support portal) on the TriTech &lt;http://www.tritech.com/&gt; website



Proudly serving our customers,
TriTech Customer Service</textOnly>
