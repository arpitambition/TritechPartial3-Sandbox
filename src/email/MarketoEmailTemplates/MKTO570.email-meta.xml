Discover the Power of TriTech.com IQ
Cloud-based public safety search and analytics
In 2012, TriTech released Inform IQ, an innovative public safety search and analytics suite, and it instantly became an APCO Hot Product. &lt;http://psc.apcointl.org/2012/10/26/2012-hot-products/&gt; IQ gives communications center personnel the power of free-text search, real-time notifications, and ad hoc reporting and analysis capabilities to deliver information quickly and securely.
