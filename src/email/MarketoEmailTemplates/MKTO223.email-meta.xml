Consolidation:  Breaking Technological and Political Barriers to Build Regional Partnerships
Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Public Safety Professional}},
 
 Thank you for your registering for our webinar on Consolidation:  Breaking Technological and Political Barriers to Build Regional Partnerships.  We know how busy things get and understand that you couldn&apos;t make it, but we thought you might be interested in viewing the recording.  

From the presentation, Charlie&apos;s key takeaways include: 

Consolidation...


 - doesn&apos;t necessarily mean the elimination of an organization.  
 - is a refinement and effective way to bring together operations in a region to better serve the community
 - make systems very efficient through personnel and technology, and being creative with how we approach them.
