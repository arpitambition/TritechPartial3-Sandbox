Justify Your Trip to TriCON
TriTech&apos;s Annual User Conference  l  September 26 - 28, 2012
Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Client}},

Justifying your TriCON attendance to management can be challenging. The reality is that TriCON is the most cost effective and efficient method of obtaining education and in establishing a professional network.  


TriCON&apos;s value lies in the conference’s content and the focused interaction it provides. Sometimes learning one new piece of information or gaining a better understanding about only one process can justify the entire cost of attending TriCON. And making one professional contact can be worth much more. 

 To help your agency be part of this important educational event, we&apos;re providing you with an TriCON Justification Letter.
