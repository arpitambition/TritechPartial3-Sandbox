    <subject>Introducing the New EMS CAM Connection August Newsletter</subject>
    <textOnly>August 2011 Edition
 
Welcome to our first edition of the TriTech Software Systems: CAM Connection for EMS Solutions. CAM stands for “Customer Account Manager” and in an effort to bring you more customized and timely information, we have developed this publication exclusively for the customers of our EMS Solutions group. To keep current customers up-to-date with the most relevant information, we will be sending you this monthly newsletter. While your respective sales rep has not changed, their title has. Your CAM will continue to manage your account and communicate with you via email, phone and through this CAM Connection newsletter.   Feel free to let us know if you have suggestions on topics you would like to hear about.
