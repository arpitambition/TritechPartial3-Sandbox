SAN DIEGO, CA (June 8, 2012) – TriTech Software Systems proudly introduces CAD+9-1-1, a revolutionary solution designed to address the future challenges of Next Generation PSAPs, at the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) Conference in Long Beach, California. Building upon TriTech’s proven CAD technology and the acquisition of 911-Inc., CAD+9-1-1 is the convergence of 9-1-1 call processing with CAD’s inherent ability to take action through the real-time exchange of incoming and historical information – all in one solution. 

“As the full scope and standards for Next Generation 9-1-1 continue to emerge, NG9-1-1 will require public safety agencies, personnel, and their software solutions to be able to interact with all forms of data,” says Darrin Reilly, Chief Operating Officer of TriTech Software Systems. “TriTech’s CAD+9-1-1 solution addresses the challenges of NG9-1-1 head-on through CAD’s ability to dynamically manage the entire incident life cycle and incorporate NG9-1-1 capabilities into a unified, seamless workflow.”

TriTech’s CAD+9-1-1 workflow solution leverages the ability of CAD to be spatially aware. Incoming phone calls and SMS messages can now be triaged even before the call taker answers the phone. The system will provide users with immediate situational awareness about the potential that an incident is related to another call already in the system. This will allow call takers to proactively manage their workload and minimize call answer times by prioritizing more urgent calls to the top of the queue. By consolidating CAD and 9-1-1 events into a common user experience, call takers and dispatchers now have a 360 degree view for improved situational awareness of incoming and active calls through CAD’s robust database of location and phone number history, mapping capabilities, and response management.

“As one of the first vendors to introduce an integrated mapping solution into its CAD system, TriTech continues to lead the way in bringing innovative solutions to the market,” continues Darrin. “Building upon our proven CAD platform currently utilized in some of the most complex and demanding communication centers around the globe, CAD+9-1-1 integrates the data awareness of CAD intelligence into the call taking process. By enabling emergency communications personnel to manage, prioritize, and interact with new types of data, including text messages and multimedia, and packaging it together in an easy-to-use format, TriTech is Next Generation now.”  

TriTech will be providing demonstrations of CAD+9-1-1 at the National Emergency Number Association’s (NENA) annual conference (Booth number 813) in Long Beach, CA on June 11th and 12th.
