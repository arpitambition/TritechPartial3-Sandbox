 New public safety solution provides quicker and more efficient emergency response for rapidly growing city in Texas
 
 August 14, 2012
SAN DIEGO, CA (August 14, 2012) – TriTech Software Systems &lt;http://www.tritech.com/&gt; (TriTech) proudly announces the successful implementation of its computer aided dispatch (CAD) and mobile solution for the City of Allen, Texas. The integrated CAD and mobile solutions serve as the cornerstone of the City of Allen’s technology initiatives adopted to improve overall public safety operations.  

“With the new TriTech software, our emergency operations are more efficient,” says Sid Hudson, Director of Information Technology for the City of Allen. “Through the integrated mapping and automatic vehicle locator (AVL), our dispatchers know exactly where our units are so we are able to respond more quickly.” 

Within the past few years, the City of Allen has experienced a tremendous amount of residential and retail growth. The City began to explore new technology solutions to provide public safety departments with updated tools to explore its growing needs and automate many processes which were previously manual.  

Hudson continues, “During implementation, we reviewed our internal procedures and discovered many ways that we can automate processes and remove paper shuffling. With this advanced technology, we are providing our police and fire departments with better tools to improve emergency response.”

“TriTech is committed to client success and our systems are designed to enhance our client’s operations.  We are very pleased that the City of Allen is experiencing considerable improvements from our CAD and mobile software,” says Michael Nabors, Senior Vice President of Operations for TriTech.  “By working in close partnership with the City of Allen, we are able to provide a robust public safety system to effectively service their citizens today and ensure continued progress toward further operational improvements into the future.
