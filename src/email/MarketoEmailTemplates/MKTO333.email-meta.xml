Complimentary Training:  Everything You Need to Know About VisiCAD 5.2

Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

Did you miss TriCON last year?  Or maybe you came, but upgrading to VisiCAD 5.2 seemed too far away. Well, in mid-June VisiCAD 5.2 will be available and we want to get you ready to move forward. VisiCAD 5.2 is filled with significant enhancements to enable an agency’s personnel to be more efficient and productive such as Advisor, Internet Integration, VisiNet Configuration, System Health Monitor, and much more. &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/rs/ortivusna/images/VisiCAD Regional Training 5 2 PDF.pdf&gt;
