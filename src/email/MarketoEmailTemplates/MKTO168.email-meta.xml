           Product Highlights

 Stratus ftServer:  &quot;We&apos;ve been running our original ftServer system for nine years now with absolutely no downtime.&quot; 
 According to St. Charles County Dispatch and Alarm IT Manager Travis Hill, “The only thing we ever had to do was replace one hard drive, which we did without stopping the system. And it’s been running continuously since without a problem.” Hill adds, “What’s great about the ftServer system is I never have to worry about it. Any time there’s been an issue Stratus has called me first. They know about the problem before I do and they usually fix it before I even realize there was anything going on.”  Read more to learn more about how St. Charles County Department of Dispatch and Alarm is using their TriTech and Stratus solution&gt;&gt;

   Tech Tip – Where is everyone?
   
 UWHO and WHO Recall PowerLine Commands will report who is logged into what unit or workstation in VisiCAD Command and are configurable for your agency.  
 
 The UWHO will show what personnel are assigned to what units.  This is useful when units are brought on duty with personnel (or via Rostering).

 Customer Feature
 
 Marion County Public Safety Communications Center, FL Continues to Consolidate with TriTech
 A long time TriTech client since 2000, Marion County Public Safety Communications initially operated as Marion County Fire Rescue. In 2008, as part of the ambulance service transition, dispatch was re-organized under the Public Safety Communications department dispatching both fire rescue and emergency medical transport services. In October 2011, the Marion County Board of Commissioners and Marion County Sheriff&apos;s Office unanimously supported an agreement to consolidated the Sheriff&apos;s Office dispatch staff with existing Public Safety staff. 
  “We are excitedly moving forward on our consolidation project with the Sheriff’s Office,” says Karl Oltz, Director for Marion County Public Safety Communications. “By consolidating dispatching personnel and operations under the singular VisiCAD computer-aided dispatch system, we are improving the efficiency and technical capabilities of emergency communications to benefit the general welfare of the citizens throughout Marion County.&quot; Click here to read more about the Marion County Consolidation project&gt;&gt;
