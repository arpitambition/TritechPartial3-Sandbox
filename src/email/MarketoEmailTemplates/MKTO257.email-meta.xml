TriTech Aligns Resources
One Company Annoucement
In a continuing effort to bring all TriTech resources under one unified group, TriTech Software Systems would like to inform you of some exciting news. Within the next few months, you will see the following changes:

Cohesive Branding
Each TriTech office location - Wilmington, NC; North Grafton, MA; Centennial, CO; Decorah, IA; and San Diego, CA – will implement the new TriTech brand across all areas, from office signs to documentation.

Leading Edge Technology
TriTech is able to share developmental innovations and resources to advance solutions and bring leading-edge technology to market faster. TriTech’s technology expertise, development processes and best practices will be shared across all product lines.

Employee Expertise
Did you know that TriTech’s 350+ employees average more than a decade of public safety industry experience? This means a stronger industry presence (i.e. iCERT, APCO, IJIS, IACP, NENA, etc.), shared field experience and better communication with our 2,500 customer agencies.

Customer Service Excellence
Excellence in customer service is being standardized across the company utilizing best practices, common processes and performance benchmarks. TriTech’s National Support Center will continue to monitor customer satisfaction and listen and respond to your needs to deliver the best customer support experience in the industry. Courtesy, quality, excellent service – our promise to you.

New Logo
As of May 1, 2012, all former brands are now “TriTech Software Systems.” To celebrate our strength and cohesiveness as one company, a new TriTech logo will be introduced (upper right-hand corner of this email) that emphasizes our identity as one company, built upon the strengths of the best and most experienced minds in public safety software. 

All of these changes mean TriTech is able to offer the most complete, integrated, end-to-end, enterprise-wide public safety software solution – more so than any other company in the industry. We’re large enough to withstand economic swings, but not so large that you, our customers, won’t get the personal service you need and deserve.  

Thank you for the opportunity to let TriTech serve as your public safety technology provider. One company…many solutions…
