    <textOnly>In This Issue



Welcome to the Third Quarterly TriTech Customer Newsletter.

In the last issue &lt;http://offers.tritech.com/TriTechNews_Q2_2012_CA_Main.html&gt;, we highlighted a new logo, a multi-city customer VisiCAD 5.2 training, a new brand name, the TriCON annual conference agenda sneak peak, industry news and webinars, and client go-lives.

In this edition, you will find important updates on products, documentation, technology, monthly customer service webinars, the tritech.com website, and TriCON. I encourage you to take a few minutes to review this information, and I’ll start off with a couple timely and important topics.

I know that some of you were able to view the exciting new CAD user interface changes we unveiled at the NENA conference in Long Beach, CA. I encourage you to come see our team at the APCO Conference in Minneapolis, MN (August 19-21) where we will be demonstrating this new approach to CAD workflow. We will be doing a deep dive on this new approach to CAD call-taking and dispatch at TriCON and would love to have you there to review and provide feedback on this new functionality. 

We also encourage all customers to be a part of this year’s TriTech Annual Users Conference (TriCON &lt;http://www.tritech.com/tricon&gt;) in San Diego on September 26-28. We’d love to visit with you in person about the exciting evolution happening with your software and work with you on developing the best use of it to accomplish your organizational goals. Please make sure to finalize your plans for APCO and TriCON soon.

Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your public safety technology provider.
