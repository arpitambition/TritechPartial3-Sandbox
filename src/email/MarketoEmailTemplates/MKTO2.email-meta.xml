THIS MONTH&apos;S TECH TIPS
Q. How can I get a report on what queries were run to the state?
A. In the state interface under the Reports menu choose Query Report or Response Report, which will give you that information.

Q. My F2 Help file is missing. Where is it located?
A. The F2 help file IMCCMN.CHM should be located in the C:\Windows folder. Sometimes the file does not get copied there or the user does not have sufficient rights to open the file. The file is also located in the IMC\CMN folder. To resolve the error try copying the file from the CMN folder to the Windows folder. If it is there already, make sure it can be opened by double clicking on it. If the system administrator is unwilling to give users access to the Windows folder the file can be copied from the network CMN folder to a local folder or desktop, and opened from there.

Q. How do I find the Persistent Route Statements on the Message Switch PC?
A.  1. Go to Start
    2. Click on Run
    3. Type in “CMD” and hit enter
    4. Type in “route print”
    5. It will display on the screen
Note: If you want to save it to a Text file add “&gt; MyFile.txt” and it will be saved in the directory your command prompt is displaying. For example: route print &gt;MyFile.txt
