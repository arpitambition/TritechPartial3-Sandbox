    <subject>Revision to GA12-004 - Multi-Environmental Selector / TriTech.Launch and Windows 7</subject>
    <textOnly>POSTED: 04-05-12


Dear Clients,

On March 20, 2012 we published GA12-004 - Multi-Environmental Selector and Windows 7.  After further review, we have determined that the information covered in this advisory also applies to TriTech.Launch.  The revised Advisory is discussed below.

With the release of Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems, Microsoft has removed the Power Users group elevated permissions. This directly affects the Power Users group memberâ€™s ability to map ODBC settings when the Multi-Environmental Selector or TriTech.Launch is used.  There are at least two ways to work around this issue which are discussed in this advisory.

You may access this advisory via the MyVisiNet Support site under Documentation | Tech Advisories | VisiNet Advisories | 2012.

Sincerely,

Tony Vardiman
