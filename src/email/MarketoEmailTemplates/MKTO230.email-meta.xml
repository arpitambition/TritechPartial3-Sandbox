    <textOnly>REMINDER: Sweet Software Group Training in Ankeny, IA Next Week


We&apos;re looking forward to seeing you next week for our Sweet Software Group Training. If you have questions or if there is anything we can do to make this a better experience for you, please contact us at: 

Kathy Swanson, Ankeny Fire Department: 
(515) 965-6476 | kswanson@ankenyiowa.gov 

Brenda Taylor, TriTech Sales Representative: (800) 537-3927 ext. 6233 | brenda.taylor@tritech.com

Here is a link to download a copy of the agenda, if you&apos;d like: &lt;http://www.tritechems.com/documents/_UG/Sample_2-day_Group_Training_agenda.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&gt;. 

Registration will begin on the first day at 7:45 a.m. We sincerely hope that these two days of education will allow everyone to gain knowledge in the areas desired. Although this is classroom-style training, feel free to bring a laptop if you have access to one and you will be able to participate in some “hands-on” activities. 

We invite you to dress casually and comfortably for the session. Since room temperatures and preferences vary from person to person, please bring a sweater or sweatshirt to wear if needed.  

See you next week!
