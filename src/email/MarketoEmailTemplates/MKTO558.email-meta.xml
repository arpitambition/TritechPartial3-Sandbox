What do you get when you bring together 400 TriTech customers for three days of training, networking, and brainstorming? That’s what happened in San Diego at the TriCON 2012 Annual User Conference in October. This was the first time VisionAIR and TriTech customers came together as a group, and by all accounts it was a huge success. The conference gives TriTech staff members a rare chance to meet with our customers face-to-face to better understand issues, concerns, and solutions that are going on in the field. Customers get direct access to TriTech staff to get their questions answered in sessions and in hands-on labs. Perhaps, most importantly, it is a chance for you to meet your peers and exchange ideas on how other agencies are using the TriTech systems. With more than 2,700 installations of TriTech systems across the globe, there are many different ways to solve the same problems and many common solutions.

This year my favorite event was when we unveiled our new products during the general session on the first day. We showed a new CAD version with a brand new workflow and an integrated telephone interface. This is the culmination of nearly a year of research and development, and will serve as the new, common platform for both VisiCAD and VisionCAD customers. Look for more information coming your way as we move into limited availability testing in mid-2013.
 
 
We also demonstrated the first release of our next generation Police RMS. The thin-client RMS and FBR deliver a streamlined look and feel that is easier to use. The system provides a new Pinboard module, Facebook-style timeline for suspects, and a wizard-based Field Based Reporting interface.

We also unveiled the newest version of Inform IQ, a query, dashboard, and reporting tool that aggregates data from CAD, RMS, and 9-1-1 to give users a powerful investigating and analytics platform. Early reviews from our pre-release customers have been overwhelmingly positive.

Next year, TriCON will be held in San Diego again, and we expect to have an even bigger turnout. Please look for more information about dates to reserve your spot soon. You can’t afford to miss this event!

Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your public safety technology provider.

Chris Maloney, President and CEO
