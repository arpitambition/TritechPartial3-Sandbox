CRM Transition Updates

Dear Clients,


As we informed you last Tuesday, December 6th, we are very excited to be on the final stages of deployment of TriTech’s new Customer Relationship Management Portal called SalesForce.  As planned, we are migrating from ServiceWise, our current customer portal, to SalesForce, the new customer portal, this weekend.   

Please read the full communication that provides you with important information related to this change, how it impacts you, and some Frequently Asked Questions that will help you throughout the transition.  You may access the full communication via the MyVisiNet Support site under Documentation | General Documents | Customer Service.


Sincerely, 


Tony Vardiman
