SAN DIEGO, CA (October 23, 2012) – TriTech Software Systems &lt;http://www.tritech.com/products/tritech_com&gt; (TriTech) will be featuring and educating the EMS Industry on Cloud-based EMS offerings at Page, Wolfberg, and Wirth’s ABC3 Conference in Hershey, PA this week. TriTech offers Cloud-based and Premise-based solutions for EMS Billing, ePCR, and Computer-Aided Dispatch. TriTech.com Cloud-based options for EMS providers allow anywhere-access to EMS software in a secured environment. Cloud-based options also reduce IT overhead costs, enable a quicker go-live, and offer multiple pricing models to best meet business needs.

Cloud-based computing - also known by names such as SaaS, Online, or web-based - is a commonly accepted method of doing business and more and more EMS providers are choosing this option in their software purchase decisions. TriTech was the first EMS vendor to offer Cloud-based EMS Billing, beginning in 2003. This trend continues to grow and our TriTech EMS team can provide expertise consultation backed by years of experience to help EMS Services “Get on the TriTech.com Cloud.”

“The online version of the TriTech billing program [TriTech.com Billing] is extremely 
convenient in the unpredictable world of EMS,&quot; said Bill Edson, COO of Middlebury Ambulance Association in Vermont. &quot;It is user-friendly, very easy to learn, allows for fast reimbursement turn-around, and is an affordable option for our billing operations. It was a game changer for our organization.”
