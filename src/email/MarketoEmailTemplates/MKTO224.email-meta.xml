    <subject>Introducing TriTech News - Quarterly Newsletter</subject>
    <textOnly>In This Issue


Welcome to the first customer newsletter under our TriTech Software Systems name. We want to keep you, our valued customers, well informed of product and service announcements, company information, technical tips and key industry information through vehicles like this customer newsletter. Over the last six months we have assembled the leading  public safety  software providers together with one single focus. That  effort has unified the best people and products in the industry  today,  resulting in the most trusted and innovative enterprise-wide solutions in 911 Dispatch, Law, Fire and EMS. 

Many of the names and faces at TriTech will already be familiar as the company continues to operate from existing office locations in Castle Hayne, NC; North Grafton, MA; Denver, CO; Decorah, IA; and San Diego, CA – but under a single structure, team and company. With the rich collection of knowledge brought into a single public safety  software solution – developed, sold and supported under  one company – TriTech is able to offer a complete, integrated, end-to-end enterprise-wide solution from a single company that’s large enough to withstand economic swings, but not so large that customers don’t get the attention they deserve.
 
 Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your public safety software business   partner.

Mike Lyons, VP of Operations
 TriTech Software Systems
