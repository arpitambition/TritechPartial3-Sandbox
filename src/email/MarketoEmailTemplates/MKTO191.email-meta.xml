    <subject>GA12-007 - Recommendation to Enable System Auditing</subject>
    <textOnly>POSTED: 03-20-12


Dear Clients,

TriTech recommends that System Administrators enable System Auditing on the TriTech VisiCAD share so that file and folder deletions can be tracked. Enabling this feature within Windows will allow System Administrators to verify if files or folders are deleted from the directory that is being audited. This can be useful in the event that a file or folder is deleted accidentally, as it confirms when the deletion occurred as well as who performed the deletion. Since enabling this feature does not consume a significant amount of system resources, it provides an increased level of system security without compromising the performance of the system. Please read the Advisory for full details.

You may access this advisory via the MyVisiNet Support site under Documentation | Tech Advisories | VisiNet Advisories | 2012.

Sincerely,

Tony Vardiman
