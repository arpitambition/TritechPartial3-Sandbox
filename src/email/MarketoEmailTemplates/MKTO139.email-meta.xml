Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},

We encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity and tell us what we can do to make our documentation more useful.   Please click this link (http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2011-VisiNetDocumentation)  to complete a quick 5-minute documentation survey. 

For your participation in our Documentation Survey, all new and previously entered survey responses will be included in a drawing for a Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire.  The deadline for entry is Monday, December 5.

Sincerely,

Yvonne Stringer
