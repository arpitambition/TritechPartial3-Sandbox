Press Release
Darrin Reilly, Public Safety Industry Leader and Innovator, joins TriTech Software Systems as Chief Operating Officer



“Only one company in the industry has the depth to respond to the next generation of public safety requirements” - Darrin Reilly, COO, TriTech Software Systems.



June 5, 2012
SAN DIEGO, CA (June 5, 2012) – TriTech Software Systems (TriTech) is pleased to announce Darrin Reilly has been selected as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Darrin will be responsible for leading research and development, implementation and customer service for TriTech’s rich portfolio of public safety products. In addition, Darrin will actively participate in the development of strategic initiatives together with the company’s CEO and the Board of Directors.



“Darrin is uniquely qualified for his new role at TriTech. Darrin comes into the role with more than 25 years of complex information technology experience, of which over 20 is directly associated to public safety, with some of the best known names in the industry,” said Chris Maloney, TriTech’s Chief Executive Officer. “His most recent experience was serving as the COO for Cassidian Communications. Prior to joining Cassidian, Darrin served as the President of Positron. Darrin began his public safety career working at Motorola, in ever increasing roles leading up to his assignment as their Vice President and General Manager for their Biometrics Business Unit (formerly known as Printrak International). Darrin’s experience and proven success will help us refine our vision for our next generation Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Emergency 9-1-1 workflow products which will make their debut during the next 90 days. At TriTech, we plan to fully leverage Darrin’s business leadership experience as we enhance our applications and services portfolio, including E9-1-1 call processing, which will be a strong focus of the company going forward.”



Darrin joined TriTech because of the company’s distinct position as a leader in the market and the depth of the company’s product portfolio. “Only one company in the industry has the depth to respond to the next generation of public safety requirements,” said Darrin. “With TriTech’s recent acquisitions of VisionAIR, Inc. and 911-Inc., in addition to the strong backing from its private equity investor, FFL, the company has positioned itself to be in the driver’s seat as the premier provider of applications and services within the public safety industry. The infrastructure building blocks for the nationwide interoperable broadband Public Safety wireless network and standards emerging around NextGen 9-1-1 will provide the digital bookends to support advanced transaction services (voice, data and video applications) which TriTech is uniquely positioned to provide. With TriTech’s vision, talented leadership and experience of more than 20 years of developing data-driven workflow management systems, the next era of data-centric emergency response and public safety will soon become a reality.”



TriTech is unveiling the industry’s first integrated CAD and E9-1-1 next generation workflow solution at the upcoming National Emergency Number Association’s (NENA) annual conference (Booth number 813) in Long Beach, CA on June 11th and 12th. TriTech’s senior management team will be in attendance to discuss their joint vision of next generation public safety solutions and services.
