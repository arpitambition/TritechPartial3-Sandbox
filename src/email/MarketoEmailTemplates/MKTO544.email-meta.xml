Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Client}},

TriCON Annual Training presents ideas and insight from some of the best minds in public safety -- YOU! We&apos;re looking for clients to present best practices using TriTech products, leadership insights, or general lessons learned in your agency.

Don&apos;t want to present? We still want your input and ideas for informative session topics - TriCON is developed just for you and we want to make it as valuable and educational as possible.

Help us develop a training program designed just for you and submit your session ideas for TriCON.
