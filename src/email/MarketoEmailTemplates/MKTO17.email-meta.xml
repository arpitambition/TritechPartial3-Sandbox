Please enjoy a preview of one of the Monday Power Seminars on Implementing Fire Service EMS with Mike Ragone, Consultant with Fitch and Associates. Copy and paste into your browser window: http://tritech.ilinc.com/perl/ilinc/lms/vc_launch.pl?activity_id=jjrfcbp&amp;user_id=

Note, In our efforts to provide a balanced message, there is also a session being offered at Pinnacle on July 26 called “Fireproofing Your Market” which speaks from the perspective of those organizations providing EMS services in the areas where the fire departments decide to provide those services as well. The goal in these two sessions is not to tell each side they are right or wrong, but provide tools and hopefully some rules of engagement.


TriTech is proud to be a Pinnacle Platinum Sponsor!
