2. If custom replication is installed – remove prior to the upgrade. This can be reinstalled post upgrade.

b. Reporting Servers if replication is installed (this includes all legs of replication but does not include any custom replication servers).

c. Mobile Servers


5. All Mobile upgrades including patches require the Mobile server to be offline (Mobile Down), approximately 1 hour per mobile server; may vary depending of database size (30 minutes for patches).
