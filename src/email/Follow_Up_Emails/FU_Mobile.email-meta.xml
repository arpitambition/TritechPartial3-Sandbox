    <textOnly>Dear XXXX 

It was a pleasure discussing the capabilities of VisiNet Mobile data solution and the benefits it can provide to your agency.  Mobile serves as a natural extension of VisiCAD Command providing real-time access to mission critical information to field personnel.
 
Benefits of VisiNet Mobile include:  
 
Real-time access to CAD, RMS, CJIS and other and other public/proprietary databases to enhance personnel safety and improve situational awareness.  

Detailed routing instruction with visual map overlay, turn-by-turn text directions, and voice-over navigation expedites response to the incident location.  

Extensive messaging capabilities to easily facilitate Mobile to Dispatch and Mobile to Mobile communications  

Easy to maintain through multiple, simultaneous network connections for secure automatic over-the-air update provisioning 
 
I look forward to speaking with you more and providing you with a first hand look at VisiNet Mobile&apos;s functionality.  Please provide me some dates and times and we can set up a webex product demonstration.  
 
Regards,
