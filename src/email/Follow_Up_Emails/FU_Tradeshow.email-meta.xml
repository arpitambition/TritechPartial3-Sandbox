    <textOnly>Dear XXXX 

It was a pleasure meeting you at the recent XXXXX in XXXXX. I hope you had a great time and look forward to discussing further how TriTech solutions can benefit your agency. 

From our initial discussion regarding XXXX (i.e. problem they need to solve), our solutions can benefit your agency&apos;s operations. When Client XXXX was facing [the same problem the attendee indicated], we helped them find a way to XXXXX. 

I look forward to speaking with you more about how TriTech&apos;s solutions can help you XXXXX (problem they needto solve.) To set up a site visit and product demonstration, please contact me at (858)799-XXXXXor email XXXXXX@tritech.com
