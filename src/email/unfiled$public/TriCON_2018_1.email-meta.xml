    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Are you registered yet for TriCON 2018? There is going to be so much great training and networking this year. I don&apos;t want you to miss out on this opportunity. Details about the event can be found at this link: http://www.tritech.com/news/tricon.

I&apos;ve attached a justification letter that you can use to gain approval to attend. You’ll need to edit it to put your approver&apos;s name at the top and your name at the bottom. Let me know if there’s anything more you need regarding justification, I can see what else I can do.

If you register by January 29, we can even offer your agency an early bird discount, saving you $100 off your registration fee. It&apos;s a great investment in your software, really helping you get the most out of your system.

Good luck! Let me know what else you might need on this. We&apos;d love to see you at TriCON 2018.
